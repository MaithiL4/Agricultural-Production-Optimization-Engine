# Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine.
# We have to Optimize Productivity.
# By understanding requirements of climatic and soil conditions for crops.
# Helps us to cope up with wether unpredictability.

# we are using python as Programming language. 
# we got the Predefined Dataset Kaggle.
# We are going to use python libraries : Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, IPyWidgets
# 1. Numpy: The name “Numpy” stands for “Numerical Python”. It is the commonly used library. It is a popular machine learning library that supports large matrices and multi-dimensional data. It consists of in-built mathematical functions for easy computations. Even libraries like TensorFlow use Numpy internally to perform several operations on tensors. Array Interface is one of the key features of this library.

# 2. Pandas: Pandas are an important library for data scientists. It is an open-source machine learning library that provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data. Pandas support operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc.

# 3. Seaborn: is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# 4. Matplotlib: This library is responsible for plotting numerical data. And that’s why it is used in data analysis. It is also an open-source library and plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, graphs, etc.

# 5. IPyWidgets is a Python library of HTML interactive widgets for Jupyter notebook. Each UI element in the library can respond to events and invokes specified event handler functions. They enhance the interactive feature of Jupyter notebook application.

# 6. Scikit-learn: It is a famous Python library to work with complex data. Scikit-learn is an open-source library that supports machine learning. It supports variously supervised and unsupervised algorithms like linear regression, classification, clustering, etc. This library works in association with Numpy and SciPy.
